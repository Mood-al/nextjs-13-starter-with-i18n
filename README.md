A next 13 starter with i18n, react-bootstrap, typescript, api routes for handling auth, custom hooks and more....

I created this project and will add more to it to use it in my future applications development.

## Features

- i18n out of the box in the server and client components.
- useful custom components and hooks (there are components to handle inputs and forms with validation and auto dir detection go to /login to see how they work).
- auth is already configured all you have to do is go to AuthContext to uncomment the fetch lines and to /api folder and add your api url in the files there.
- api routes to handle auth and httponly cookie
- uses bootstrap so all you have to do is just paste your bootstrap theme to bootstrap.css file

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

if you had issues with packages conflict just add `--f` flag to force the packages installation.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
